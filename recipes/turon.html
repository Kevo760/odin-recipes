    <h2>Plantain Egg Rolls</h2>
    <p>This is a Filipino dessert that has been my favorite since I was a child. Crispy, sugary shells with soft and warm plantains inside. They are a breeze to make when you have everything set up in advance. They can be frozen in bulk and fried without any defrosting. </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ cup water</li>
        <li>20 spring roll wrappers</li>
        <li>5 plantains, peeled and quartered</li>
        <li>⅓ cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups vegetable oil </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Put sugar and water in separate bowls. Separate spring roll wrappers; stack. Peel plantains; cut in half and then half again lengthwise.</li>
        <li>Place 1 wrapper on a clean work surface with 1 corner facing you. Coat 1 plantain piece in sugar; place 1 inch from the near corner of the wrapper. Fold corner over the plantain; roll up halfway. Fold in 2 side corners; continue rolling until near the top. Moisten top corner with wet fingers; finish rolling. Repeat with remaining wrapper</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place egg rolls in a single layer; fry until golden brown on the bottom, 2 to 3 minutes. Flip; sprinkle with brown sugar. Fry 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer egg rolls to a plate.</li>
    </ol>
